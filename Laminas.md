## Wiki Education Foundation-supported course assignment

subject of a Wiki Education Foundation-supported course assignment.
Further details are available [on the course
page](Wikipedia:Wiki_Ed/North_Carolina_State_University/Object_Oriented_Design_and_Development_(Spring_2017) "wikilink").

## Cleanup

I am not a wikipedian so I don't know the exact policies (maybe
[Wikipedia:NOTGUIDE](Wikipedia:NOTGUIDE "wikilink") and
[Wikipedia:NPOV](Wikipedia:NPOV "wikilink")), but I do know for sure
that an article shouldn't read like an about page mixed together with a
getting started guide. I added the cleanup rewrite. Feel free to change
it whatever is appropriate if you know more about the applicable
policies than me.

## Neutrality

I think the article is a bit biased and I'm not sure if it forfills the
requirements for having an article -- <font color="green">**Snailwalker

The article as it currently exists reads like an advertisement for Zend.
To say that it could be restated a bit more objectively does not
diminish what Zend has accomplished with the framework. As to whether it
deserves to be an article, I personally find it useful to have a
reference point to explain new technologies - [Mark
Dixon](User:Elmarco "wikilink") 19:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

  
Zend Framework is yet well-known in PHP community, so we should leave
the article as it is now. [LaminatedCat](User:LaminatedCat "wikilink")

Why should be leave a [biased](WP:NPOV "wikilink") article just because
the technology is well-known? I'm going to start making it fit neutral
point of view policy. [Superm401](User:Superm401 "wikilink") -

In the interest of full disclosure, I'm the project lead for Zend
Framework at Zend Technologies. That said, I'm very interested in this
article representing a full and neutral viewpoint of ZF. At the moment
it is out of date and doesn't reflect the current goals of the project
well; I've made some minor edits to update some information that I hope
you will agree are not biased in any way towards Zend. Can you please
let me know what the concerns RE: neutrality have been in the past so
that I avoid any changes that might bring the neutrality of this article
in to question? Thanks. [wllm](User:wllm "wikilink") 08:47 16 December

Hi all, there is some very out-of-date information on this page, and I
would really like to update it to reflect the latest. I didn't want to
do this, however, until I understood more about the concerns involving
neutrality. If any of the users above are still watching this page,
please respond via this page or email. If I don't get any responses
after 1 week, I plan to update this page because we have a very
important release coming up and expect more interest in any info online-
wikipedia being not the least of information sources! :) In any case, I
will try to get the language as neutral as I can, and I plan to have
someone outside Zend review it before submitting any changes. Thanks!
[wllm](User:wllm "wikilink") 04:38 22 December 2007 (UTC)

  
OK, I'm going ahead with the edits. This will be a major update to this
page. Please mail me if you find anything less-than-neutral :) in this
article. We're interested in updated and complete information, not
biased information. Thanks! [wllm](User:wllm "wikilink") 19:45, 3

The article, particularly the introduction, still reads like an advert.
Disclaimer: I love ZF. But I'm afraid it may be too difficult for you to
edit this article and remain neutral.

## It is a new framework

This framework is so new(2006, March). It has a long way to got, and
their goal is to provide some tools to help developers and complete
their library and rule to become an acceptable framework. It is a very
promising collection any way as I am using it. It has an implementation
of MVC design pattern.

## External Links

What external links are appropriate for this page? There was a link to
the Zend Framework Forum that was deleted. What is the reason? I have
read the link. If you think it should be deleted then state your reason
here. <small>—Preceding [unsigned](Wikipedia:Signatures "wikilink")

It's a forum, which should normally be avoided. See

## Cleaned

I've sourced what could be sourced, and removed what could not be
sourced, with the exception of the Features section... Unless anybody
has any objections, I feel okay with removing the refimprove. And to
wllm... I'm sorry I had to butcher your edits (I personally like ZF very
much), but I think you'll find that people who frequent wikipedia can
smell advertising a mile away, and you'll actually have more goodwill
from everyone with a neutral, encyclopedic and sourced article.

## Links to non-english communities

Is there any point to have links to French, Polish and Spanish Zend
"communities" in this article? I think these links are not useful to
English speakers, and for those who do need them they can find them on
the French, Polish, etc. article. So if there are no objections, I'll
remove them in a few days. Thanks.

Actually, according to
[Wikipedia:El#Non-English_language_content](Wikipedia:El#Non-English_language_content "wikilink"),
these links shouldn't be here at all so I'm going to remove them now.

## Biased article, please revise

The article reads like an advertisement, and should either be edited to
show only the relevant facts, not ".. has reached production quality" or
".. a code formatter, code completion, parameter assist, and more.". I
expect to see these things on the side of a software box at Best Buy, or
on a software website, it has no place here.

more sources are needed or change some of the.

## The Anatomy of Zend Framework

I am adding a section which will cover the anatomy of Zend Framework. It
will be a detailed and informative based on the literature. Here is one
of the document that is promising to further enhance this document.
