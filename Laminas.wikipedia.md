== Cleanup ==
I am not a wikipedian so I don't know the exact policies (maybe [[Wikipedia:NOTGUIDE]] and [[Wikipedia:NPOV]]), but I do know for sure that an article shouldn't read like an about page mixed together with a getting started guide. I added the cleanup rewrite. Feel free to change it whatever is appropriate if you know more about the applicable policies than me.

== Neutrality ==

I think the article is a bit biased and I'm not sure if it forfills the requirements for having an article -- <font color="green">'''Snailwalker |''' </font>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Snailwalker '''talk'''] 13:51, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
:The article as it currently exists reads like an advertisement for Zend.  To say that it could be restated a bit more objectively does not diminish what Zend has accomplished with the framework.  As to whether it deserves to be an article, I personally find it useful to have a reference point to explain new technologies - [[User:Elmarco|Mark Dixon]] 19:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
::Zend Framework is yet well-known in PHP community, so we should leave the article as it is now. [[User:LaminatedCat|LaminatedCat]] 10:45, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
:::Why should be leave a [[WP:NPOV|biased]] article just because the technology is well-known?  I'm going to start making it fit neutral point of view policy.  [[User:Superm401|Superm401]] - [[User_talk:Superm401|Talk]] 08:40, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
In the interest of full disclosure, I'm the project lead for Zend Framework at Zend Technologies. That said, I'm very interested in this article representing a full and neutral viewpoint of ZF. At the moment it is out of date and doesn't reflect the current goals of the project well; I've made some minor edits to update some information that I hope you will agree are not biased in any way towards Zend. Can you please let me know what the concerns RE: neutrality have been in the past so that I avoid any changes that might bring the neutrality of this article in to question? Thanks. [[User:wllm|wllm]] 08:47 16 December 2007 (UTC)
:Hi all, there is some very out-of-date information on this page, and I would really like to update it to reflect the latest. I didn't want to do this, however, until I understood more about the concerns involving neutrality. If any of the users above are still watching this page, please respond via this page or email. If I don't get any responses after 1 week, I plan to update this page because we have a very important release coming up and expect more interest in any info online- wikipedia being not the least of information sources! :) In any case, I will try to get the language as neutral as I can, and I plan to have someone outside Zend review it before submitting any changes. Thanks! [[User:wllm|wllm]] 04:38 22 December 2007 (UTC)
::OK, I'm going ahead with the edits. This will be a major update to this page. Please mail me if you find anything less-than-neutral :) in this article. We're interested in updated and complete information, not biased information. Thanks!

:::The article, particularly the introduction, still reads like an advert. Disclaimer: I love ZF. But I'm afraid it may be too difficult for you to edit this article and remain neutral. [[User:Demonburrito|demonburrito]] ([[User talk:Demonburrito|talk]]) 08:01, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

== It is a new framework ==

This framework is so new(2006, March). It has a long way to got, and their goal is to provide some tools to help developers and complete their library and rule to become an acceptable framework. It is a very promising collection any way as I am using it. It has an implementation of MVC design pattern.


== External Links ==
What external links are appropriate for this page? There was a link to the Zend Framework Forum that was deleted. What is the reason? I have read the link. If you think it should be deleted then state your reason here.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Michael Ray|Michael Ray]] ([[User talk:Michael Ray|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Michael Ray|contribs]]) 19:54, 27 February 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:It's a forum, which should normally be avoided. See [[Wikipedia:El#Links_normally_to_be_avoided]] --[[User:Ronz|Ronz]] ([[User talk:Ronz|talk]]) 20:00, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

== Cleaned ==
I've sourced what could be sourced, and removed what could not be sourced, with the exception of the Features section... Unless anybody has any objections, I feel okay with removing the refimprove. And to wllm... I'm sorry I had to butcher your edits (I personally like ZF very much), but I think you'll find that people who frequent wikipedia can smell advertising a mile away, and you'll actually have more goodwill from everyone with a neutral, encyclopedic and sourced article. [[User:Demonburrito|demonburrito]] ([[User talk:Demonburrito|talk]]) 13:40, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

== Links to non-english communities ==

Is there any point to have links to French, Polish and Spanish Zend "communities" in this article? I think these links are not useful to English speakers, and for those who do need them they can find them on the French, Polish, etc. article. So if there are no objections, I'll remove them in a few days. Thanks. [[User:Laurent1979|Laurent]] ([[User talk:Laurent1979|talk]]) 14:31, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

:Actually, according to [[Wikipedia:El#Non-English_language_content]], these links shouldn't be here at all so I'm going to remove them now. [[User:Laurent1979|Laurent]] ([[User talk:Laurent1979|talk]]) 14:33, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

== Biased article, please revise ==

The article reads like an advertisement, and should either be edited to show only the relevant facts, not ".. has reached production quality" or ".. a code formatter, code completion, parameter assist, and more.". I expect to see these things on the side of a software box at Best Buy, or on a software website, it has no place here.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.182.6.2|24.182.6.2]] ([[User talk:24.182.6.2|talk]]) 06:19, 21 September 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== changes to introduction  ==

== The Anatomy of Zend Framework ==

I am adding a section which will cover the anatomy of Zend Framework. It will be a detailed and informative based on the literature. Here is one of the document that is promising to further enhance this document.
